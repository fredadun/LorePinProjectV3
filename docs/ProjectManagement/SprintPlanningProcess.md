# LorePin Sprint Planning Process

This document outlines the sprint planning process for the LorePin project, providing a structured approach to planning and executing sprints.

## Sprint Overview

The LorePin project follows a two-week sprint cycle. Each sprint has a specific focus and deliverables, as outlined in our sprint milestones:

1. **Sprint 1**: User Onboarding & Profiles
2. **Sprint 2**: Challenge System (Core)
3. **Sprint 3**: LoreCoins Reward System
4. **Sprint 4**: Content Discovery & Feed
5. **Sprint 5**: Social Features & Sponsor Tools
6. **Sprint 6**: Testing & Launch Prep

## Sprint Planning Meeting

### Timing and Participants

- **When**: The last day of the current sprint
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Participants**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team, AI Integration Specialist
- **Format**: In-person or video conference with screen sharing

### Meeting Agenda

1. **Sprint Review** (30 minutes)
   - Demo completed features
   - Review what was accomplished vs. planned
   - Discuss any issues or blockers encountered

2. **Sprint Retrospective** (30 minutes)
   - What went well?
   - What could be improved?
   - Action items for the next sprint

3. **Product Backlog Refinement** (30 minutes)
   - Review and update the product backlog
   - Clarify requirements for upcoming user stories
   - Estimate effort for upcoming user stories

4. **Sprint Planning** (60-90 minutes)
   - Set sprint goal
   - Select user stories for the sprint
   - Break down user stories into tasks
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Finalize sprint backlog

## Capacity Planning

### Calculating Team Capacity

1. **Determine available days**:
   - 10 working days in a two-week sprint
   - Subtract any holidays or planned time off

2. **Calculate hours per team member**:
   - 6 productive hours per day (accounting for meetings, breaks, etc.)
   - Multiply by available days

3. **Total team capacity**:
   - Sum of all team members' available hours

### Example Capacity Calculation

For a team of 5 developers with no time off:
- 5 developers × 10 days × 6 hours = 300 hours total capacity

## Velocity Calculation

### Initial Velocity

For the first sprint, estimate velocity based on:
- Team size and experience
- Complexity of the project
- Historical data from similar projects

### Ongoing Velocity

After the first sprint, calculate velocity based on:
- Story points completed in previous sprints
- Rolling average of the last 3 sprints
- Trend analysis (is velocity increasing, decreasing, or stable?)

### Example Velocity Calculation

If the team completed:
- Sprint 1: 30 story points
- Sprint 2: 35 story points
- Sprint 3: 32 story points

The average velocity would be (30 + 35 + 32) ÷ 3 = 32.33 story points per sprint.

## Story Point Estimation

### Estimation Scale

The LorePin project uses the Fibonacci sequence for story point estimation:
- 1: Very small task, trivial effort
- 2: Small task, straightforward implementation
- 3: Medium task, some complexity
- 5: Large task, significant complexity
- 8: Very large task, high complexity
- 13: Extremely complex task, may need to be broken down

### Estimation Process

1. **Planning Poker**:
   - Present the user story
   - Team members independently estimate effort
   - Reveal estimates simultaneously
   - Discuss differences in estimates
   - Re-estimate until consensus is reached

2. **Relative Sizing**:
   - Compare new user stories to previously estimated ones
   - "Is this story larger or smaller than story X?"

## Sprint Backlog Creation

### Selecting User Stories

1. **Prioritization**:
   - Business value
   - Technical dependencies
   - Risk factors
   - Team capacity

2. **Commitment**:
   - Based on team velocity
   - Slightly under capacity to allow for unexpected issues

### Breaking Down User Stories

1. **Task Creation**:
   - Frontend tasks
   - Backend tasks
   - Testing tasks
   - Documentation tasks
   - AI integration tasks

2. **Task Estimation**:
   - Estimate tasks in hours
   - Keep tasks small (1-8 hours)
   - If a task is larger, break it down further

### Example Sprint Backlog

For Sprint 2 (Challenge System):

| User Story | Story Points | Tasks | Hours |
|------------|--------------|-------|-------|
| As a sponsor, I can create a challenge | 8 | Design challenge form | 4 |
| | | Implement challenge form UI | 8 |
| | | Create challenge API | 6 |
| | | Store challenge in Firestore | 4 |
| | | Write tests | 4 |
| As a user, I can submit to a challenge | 5 | Design submission UI | 3 |
| | | Implement media upload | 8 |
| | | Create submission API | 5 |
| | | Store submission in Firestore | 3 |
| | | Write tests | 3 |

## Sprint Execution

### Daily Standup

- **When**: Every day at the same time
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Format**: Each team member answers:
  - What did I accomplish yesterday?
  - What will I work on today?
  - Are there any blockers?

### Sprint Board Management

- Update the project board daily
- Move tasks between columns as they progress
- Update task status and remaining hours

### Mid-Sprint Review

- Halfway through the sprint, review progress
- Adjust scope if necessary
- Address any blockers or issues

## Sprint Completion

### Definition of Done

A user story is considered "Done" when:
- Code is written and follows coding standards
- Unit tests are written and passing
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Feature is deployed to the staging environment
- Acceptance criteria are met and verified
- Documentation is updated

### Sprint Review

- Demo completed features to stakeholders
- Gather feedback
- Update product backlog based on feedback

### Sprint Retrospective

- Discuss what went well
- Identify areas for improvement
- Create action items for the next sprint

## AI Integration in Sprint Planning

The LorePin project incorporates AI tools in the development process:

1. **AI Tasks**:
   - Include specific AI-related tasks in user stories
   - Estimate effort for AI integration separately

2. **AI Verification**:
   - Include AI verification steps in acceptance criteria
   - Test AI components thoroughly

3. **AI Specialist Role**:
   - Include an AI specialist in sprint planning
   - Consult on feasibility and effort for AI features

## GitHub Integration

### Milestones

- Create a GitHub Milestone for each sprint
- Set the start and end dates
- Track progress as issues are closed

### Issues

- Create GitHub Issues for all user stories
- Link issues to the appropriate milestone
- Apply labels for categorization
- Assign issues to team members

### Project Board

- Use the GitHub Project Board to visualize sprint progress
- Move issues between columns as they progress
- Use automation to reduce manual updates

## Documentation

### Sprint Planning Document

For each sprint, create a sprint planning document that includes:
- Sprint goal
- Selected user stories and story points
- Team capacity and velocity
- Task breakdown and assignments
- Risks and mitigation strategies

### Sprint Review Document

After each sprint, create a sprint review document that includes:
- Completed user stories
- Actual vs. planned velocity
- Demo notes and feedback
- Action items for the next sprint

## Conclusion

This sprint planning process provides a structured approach to planning and executing sprints for the LorePin project. By following this process, the team can maintain a consistent pace of development, deliver high-quality features, and continuously improve their processes.
