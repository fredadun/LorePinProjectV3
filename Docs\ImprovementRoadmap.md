  ```typescript
  const performanceTargets = {
    pageLoadTime: '< 2 seconds',
    timeToInteractive: '< 3.5 seconds',
    firstContentfulPaint: '< 1.5 seconds',
    serverResponseTime: '< 200ms'
  }
  ```

### 2.2 Automated Performance Testing

  - Automated performance regression alerts

## 3. Accessibility Improvements

### 3.1 Accessibility Standards
- [ ] Define accessibility requirements
  - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Keyboard navigation support

### 3.2 Automated Testing
- [ ] Implement accessibility testing
  ```bash
  # Example test configuration
  jest-axe configuration
  cypress-axe for E2E testing
  ```

### 3.3 Documentation
- [ ] Create accessibility documentation
  - Accessibility guidelines
  - Testing procedures
  - Remediation processes

## 4. Mobile Development Enhancement

### 4.1 Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Expand mobile architecture documentation
  ```
