# LorePin CMS AI-Driven Content Moderation System

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design for the AI-driven content moderation system in the LorePin CMS v2.0. The system leverages multiple AI services and custom algorithms to efficiently and accurately moderate user-generated content while maintaining ethical standards and transparency.

## System Objectives

1. **Efficiency**: Reduce moderation time and increase throughput
2. **Accuracy**: Minimize false positives and false negatives
3. **Consistency**: Apply moderation policies uniformly
4. **Transparency**: Provide clear explanations for moderation decisions
5. **Ethics**: Ensure fair and unbiased moderation
6. **Adaptability**: Learn from moderator feedback and evolve over time

## Architecture Overview

The AI-driven content moderation system consists of the following components:

1. **Content Analysis Pipeline**: Processes incoming content through multiple AI services
2. **Risk Scoring Engine**: Calculates contextual risk scores based on multiple factors
3. **Decision Recommendation System**: Suggests moderation actions based on analysis
4. **Feedback Loop**: Captures moderator decisions to improve AI performance
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks accuracy metrics and identifies areas for improvement

## Content Analysis Pipeline

The content analysis pipeline processes different types of content through specialized AI services:

### Text Analysis

Text content (comments, descriptions, titles) is analyzed using:

1. **OpenAI Moderation API**:
   - Detects hate speech, harassment, self-harm, sexual content, and violence
   - Provides category-specific confidence scores
   - Returns a binary "flagged" decision and category breakdown

2. **Custom NLP Models**:
   - Detects sarcasm and subtle policy violations
   - Identifies cultural insensitivity based on regional context
   - Analyzes sentiment and emotional tone

3. **Keyword and Pattern Matching**:
   - Checks against custom dictionaries of prohibited terms
   - Identifies attempts to circumvent filters (character substitution, etc.)
   - Detects spam patterns and repetitive content

### Image Analysis

Image content is analyzed using:

1. **Google Vision API**:
   - SafeSearch detection for adult, violent, and medical content
   - Label detection for content categorization
   - Text detection for embedded text analysis
   - Face detection for privacy concerns

2. **Custom Image Classification Models**:
   - Identifies platform-specific policy violations
   - Detects branded content and potential copyright issues
   - Recognizes unsafe activities in specific contexts

3. **Image Similarity Matching**:
   - Compares against database of previously rejected images
   - Detects slight modifications of known prohibited content
   - Identifies duplicate submissions

### Video Analysis

Video content is analyzed using:

1. **AWS Rekognition Video**:
   - Content moderation throughout video duration
   - Person detection for privacy concerns
   - Label detection for content categorization
   - Text detection for embedded text analysis

2. **Custom Video Analysis**:
   - Frame-by-frame analysis at strategic intervals
   - Audio transcription and analysis
   - Scene change detection for targeted analysis
   - Activity recognition for unsafe behaviors

## Risk Scoring Engine

The risk scoring engine calculates a contextual risk score for each piece of content based on multiple factors:

### Risk Factors

1. **Content-Based Factors**:
   - AI service confidence scores
   - Content type (text, image, video)
   - Content category (challenge submission, profile, comment)
   - Keywords and patterns detected
   - Similarity to previously rejected content

2. **Context-Based Factors**:
   - Location context (e.g., nighttime cliff-diving videos)
   - Time of day when content was submitted
   - Challenge type and rules
   - Regional policies applicable to the content
   - Target audience of the challenge

3. **User-Based Factors**:
   - User history and trust score
   - Previous policy violations
   - Account age and activity level
   - User role (regular user, sponsor, etc.)
   - Geographic location

### Scoring Algorithm

The risk scoring algorithm combines these factors using a weighted approach:

```python
def calculate_risk_score(content_analysis, context_data, user_data):
    # Base scores from content analysis
    content_score = calculate_content_score(content_analysis)
    
    # Context multipliers
    context_multiplier = calculate_context_multiplier(context_data)
    
    # User trust factor (0.5 to 1.5, with 1.0 being neutral)
    user_trust_factor = calculate_user_trust_factor(user_data)
    
    # Final risk score calculation
    risk_score = (content_score * context_multiplier) / user_trust_factor
    
    # Normalize to 0-100 scale
    normalized_score = min(100, max(0, risk_score))
    
    return normalized_score
```

The specific weights and thresholds are configurable and will be tuned based on performance data.

## Decision Recommendation System

The decision recommendation system suggests moderation actions based on the risk score and analysis results:

### Recommendation Tiers

1. **Automatic Approval** (Risk Score < 20):
   - Content with very low risk scores
   - Users with high trust scores
   - Content types with low historical violation rates

2. **Low Priority Review** (Risk Score 20-50):
   - Content with some potential concerns
   - Placed in standard moderation queue
   - No urgent action required

3. **High Priority Review** (Risk Score 50-80):
   - Content with significant concerns
   - Placed in priority moderation queue
   - Recommended for prompt review

4. **Automatic Rejection** (Risk Score > 80):
   - Content with very high risk scores
   - Multiple clear policy violations
   - Requires moderator confirmation before final rejection

### Explanation Generation

For each recommendation, the system generates a human-readable explanation:

```python
def generate_explanation(content_analysis, risk_score, recommendation):
    explanation = f"Risk Score: {risk_score}/100\n"
    explanation += f"Recommendation: {recommendation}\n\n"
    
    # Add primary concerns
    explanation += "Primary concerns:\n"
    for concern in content_analysis.get_top_concerns(3):
        explanation += f"- {concern.category}: {concern.confidence}%\n"
    
    # Add context factors
    explanation += "\nContext factors:\n"
    for factor in content_analysis.get_context_factors():
        explanation += f"- {factor.name}: {factor.impact}\n"
    
    return explanation
```

These explanations help moderators understand the AI's reasoning and make informed decisions.

## Feedback Loop

The feedback loop captures moderator decisions to improve AI performance over time:

### Feedback Collection

1. **Decision Tracking**:
   - Records moderator decisions (approve, reject, escalate)
   - Captures reason codes and notes
   - Tracks agreement/disagreement with AI recommendation

2. **Explicit Feedback**:
   - Allows moderators to rate AI recommendation quality
   - Collects specific feedback on false positives/negatives
   - Gathers suggestions for improvement

3. **Implicit Feedback**:
   - Measures time spent reviewing content
   - Tracks changes to AI-suggested reason codes
   - Monitors patterns of agreement/disagreement

### Model Improvement

1. **Regular Retraining**:
   - Weekly retraining of custom models
   - Incorporation of new examples from moderator decisions
   - Adjustment of weights based on performance metrics

2. **A/B Testing**:
   - Testing of model improvements on subset of content
   - Comparison of performance metrics
   - Gradual rollout of successful improvements

3. **Continuous Evaluation**:
   - Daily performance reports
   - Identification of problematic content categories
   - Targeted improvements for specific issue areas
