# Deployment

This section documents the deployment processes, CI/CD pipelines, and environment configurations for the LorePin project.

## Contents

- [CI/CD Pipelines](./cicd-pipelines.md) - Continuous integration and deployment pipelines
- [GitHub Actions Setup](./github-actions-setup.md) - GitHub Actions configuration and workflows
- [Environment Configuration](./environment-configuration.md) - Environment-specific configurations

## Deployment Environments

The LorePin project uses three main environments:

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Active development and integration testing
- **URL**: https://dev.lorepin.com
- **Firebase Project**: lorepin-dev
- **Branch**: development
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to development branch

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: QA testing and pre-production verification
- **URL**: https://staging.lorepin.com
- **Firebase Project**: lorepin-staging
- **Branch**: test
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to test branch

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live application for end users
- **URL**: https://lorepin.com
- **Firebase Project**: lorepin-prod
- **Branch**: main
- **Deployment**: Manual approval after merge to main branch

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Build**: Compile and build the application
2. **Test**: Run automated tests
3. **Lint**: Check code quality and style
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to the appropriate environment

## GitHub Actions Workflows

We use GitHub Actions for automation with the following workflows:

- **Development Workflow**: Build, test, and deploy to development environment
- **Test Workflow**: Build, test, and deploy to staging environment
- **Production Workflow**: Build, test, and deploy to production environment
- **Pull Request Workflow**: Build and test pull requests

## Deployment Process

### Frontend Deployment

1. Build the React application
2. Run tests and linting
3. Deploy to Firebase Hosting

### Backend Deployment

1. Build the Cloud Functions
2. Run tests
3. Deploy to Firebase Functions

### Mobile Deployment

1. Build the Flutter application
2. Run tests
3. Deploy to app stores (manual process)

## Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment issues:

1. Identify the problematic deployment
2. Revert to the previous stable version
3. Deploy the reverted version
4. Investigate and fix the issue
5. Re-deploy the fixed version

## Monitoring and Logging

We use the following tools for monitoring and logging:

- Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Firebase Crashlytics
- Firebase Analytics
- Custom logging in Cloud Functions

## Security Considerations

- All deployments use HTTPS
- Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets
- Environment-specific Firebase service accounts
- Regular security audits
