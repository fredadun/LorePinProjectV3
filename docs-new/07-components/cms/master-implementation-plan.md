## Dependencies

The following dependencies exist between the different phases and components:

1. **AI Integration Dependencies**
   - Core Implementation must be completed
   - API keys for OpenAI, Google Cloud, and AWS must be available
   - Moderation Queue System must be operational

2. **Frontend Development Dependencies**
   - Core Implementation must be completed
   - UI mockups must be approved
   - API endpoints must be documented

3. **Testing Dependencies**
   - AI Integration must be at least 50% complete
   - Frontend Development must be at least 50% complete
   - Testing infrastructure must be set up

4. **Deployment Dependencies**
   - Testing must be at least 75% complete
   - All critical issues must be resolved
   - Deployment infrastructure must be available

## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified and mitigation strategies have been developed:

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| API key acquisition delays | High | Medium | Start the process early, have fallback mock implementations |
| Integration issues with AI services | High | Medium | Implement robust error handling, have fallback mechanisms |
| Frontend development delays | Medium | Low | Use component libraries, implement parallel development |
| Testing coverage gaps | Medium | Medium | Define comprehensive test plans, automate as much as possible |
| Deployment issues | High | Low | Use blue-green deployment, have rollback strategy |

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **AI Integration**
   - All AI services are integrated and working correctly
   - Risk scoring algorithm is more accurate than the previous version
   - System can handle the expected load with acceptable response times
   - API costs are within budget

2. **Frontend Development**
   - All interfaces are implemented and working correctly
   - UI is responsive and works on all target devices
   - System meets performance targets (load time < 2s)
   - Accessibility requirements are met

3. **Testing**
   - All tests are implemented and passing
   - Code coverage meets or exceeds targets
   - No critical or high-severity security vulnerabilities
   - Performance meets or exceeds targets

4. **Deployment**
   - All environments are properly configured
   - CI/CD pipeline is fully automated
   - Database migrations are reliable and tested
   - Monitoring and alerting are in place

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these principles:

1. **Iterative Development**
   - Implement features in small, testable increments
   - Regular demos and feedback sessions
   - Continuous integration and testing

2. **Quality Focus**
   - Comprehensive testing at all levels
   - Code reviews for all changes
   - Automated quality checks

3. **Documentation**
   - Detailed documentation for all components
   - API documentation
   - User guides and training materials

4. **Collaboration**
   - Regular status meetings
   - Cross-functional collaboration
   - Clear communication channels
