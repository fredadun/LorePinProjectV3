# LorePin AI-Driven Content Moderation

## Overview

This document outlines the AI-driven content moderation system for the LorePin Content Management System (CMS) v2.0. The system leverages multiple AI services and custom models to efficiently analyze and moderate user-generated content while maintaining high accuracy and ethical standards.

## Core Principles

1. **Accuracy**: Minimize false positives and false negatives through multi-layered analysis

### 3. Contextual Risk Scoring

#### 3.1 Risk Factors

- Challenge context and requirements
- Location and time context
- Platform-specific policies
- Regional legal requirements

#### 3.2 Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_risk_score(content, context, user_history):
    # Base score from content analysis
    base_score = content.explicit_score * 0.4 + content.violence_score * 0.3 + content.harassment_score * 0.3
    
    # Context multipliers
    context_multiplier = 1.0
    if context.is_sensitive_location:
        context_multiplier *= 1.2
    if context.is_night_time:
        context_multiplier *= 1.1
    if context.challenge_type == 'children_focused':
        context_multiplier *= 1.5
    
    # User history factor
    user_factor = 1.0
    if user_history.trust_score > 0.8:
        user_factor *= 0.8  # Trusted users get lower risk scores
    if user_history.previous_violations > 0:
        user_factor *= (1 + (user_history.previous_violations * 0.1))
    
    # Calculate final score (0-100)
    final_score = min(100, base_score * context_multiplier * user_factor)
    
    return final_score
```

#### 3.3 Risk Categories
- **Low Risk (0-30)**: Likely safe content, can be auto-approved
- **Medium Risk (31-70)**: Requires review, but not urgent
- **High Risk (71-90)**: Prioritized for human review
- **Critical Risk (91-100)**: Automatically held for review, may be auto-rejected

### 4. Decision Recommendation

#### 4.1 Recommendation Types
- **Approve**: Content meets all guidelines
- **Reject**: Content violates specific guidelines
- **Escalate**: Edge case requiring senior moderator review
- **Request Information**: Additional context needed from user

#### 4.2 Explanation Generation
- Specific policy violations identified
- Confidence scores for each violation
- Alternative suggestions for rejected content
- Educational information for users

#### 4.3 Decision Matrix
| Content Type | Risk Score | AI Confidence | Recommendation |
|--------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Any | 0-30 | >90% | Auto-approve |
| Any | 31-70 | >90% | Queue for review |
| Any | 71-90 | >90% | Prioritize for review |
| Any | 91-100 | >90% | Auto-reject or escalate |
| Any | Any | <70% | Escalate to human |
| Sensitive | Any | Any | Always human review |
